# VibrotactileFeebdackInDAW
This repository contains the codes used for the completion of my PhD. 

Here I have the code for the study: Vibration or Voice? Enhancing EQ Information Accessibility for Blind and Music Producers with Haptics. 
The repository contains the 30 audio tracks used in the study that simulate the screen reader's audio feedback. 
It also contains the maxpatch for the User Interface.
